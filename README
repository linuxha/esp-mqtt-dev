This code forms the basis of IOT modules using ESP8266. Developed on the unofficial programming
environment for ESP8266 on Windows, this code includes TUANPMs MQTT software with minor changes
and essentially allows MQTT or serial control of the ESP - which has inputs and outputs, will 
handle both PWM and SERIAL RGB lights and so very much more - all documented in the .DOC file
in this repository. See tech.scargill.net and the article "home control 2016".

Essentially, without modification this should work on ESP-12 boards or any others 
with 32Mb (4MB) Flash. See the doc file herein for more info. There now seems little point 
in continuing to support the old ESP-01 - and moving to the larger chips allows for OTA programming
which now works well, along with DUAL-SSID support.
